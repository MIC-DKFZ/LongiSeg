# Welcome to LongiSeg!

## What is LongiSeg?
LongiSeg is an extension of the popular [nnU-Net framework](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet), designed specifically for **longitudinal medical image segmentation**. By incorporating temporal information across multiple timepoints, LongiSeg enhances segmentation accuracy and consistency, making it a robust tool for analyzing medical imaging over time.

LongiSeg includes several methods for temporal feature merging, including the newly introduced [Difference Weighting Block](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/Longitudinal-Difference-Weighting). &nbsp; &nbsp;   [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2404.03010-B31B1B.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13416) \
For more details on the underlying nnU-Net framework, visit the [nnU-Net repository](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet).

## Getting started
LongiSeg is easy to use and follows the basic principles of the nnU-Net framework.

In order to get started, we recommend to create a virtual environment with **at least** Python 3.10, e.g. using conda

```bash
conda create -n longiseg python=3.12
```

LongiSeg is not yet available via pip, therefore you need to clone the repository and install it locally. This will also allow for easy customization of the code.

```bash
conda activate longiseg
git clone https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/LongiSeg.git
cd LongiSeg
pip install -e .
```

Finally, you need to set the paths for raw data, preprocessed data and results
```bash
export LongiSeg_raw="/path_to_data_dir/LongiSeg_raw"
export LongiSeg_preprocessed="/path_to_data_dir/LongiSeg_preprocessed"
export LongiSeg_results="/path_to_experiments_dir/LongiSeg_results"
```

If these are not set, LongiSeg will fall back to the respective nnU-Net paths, ensuring compatability with nnU-Net setups.

For more details on installation requirements and dataset structure, refer to the [nnU-Net installation](documentation/installation_instructions.md) and the [path setup](documentation/setting_up_paths.md) documentation.

## Using LongiSeg
Detailed usage instructions for LongiSeg can be found in the [documentation](documentation/how_to_use_longiseg.md).

TL;DR:
1. Prepare your [dataset](documentation/how_to_use_longiseg.md#dataset-format), ensuring it includes a `patientsTr.json` file.
2. Run [experiment planning and preprocessing](documentation/how_to_use_longiseg.md#experiment-planning-and-preprocessing): `LongiSeg_plan_and_preprocess -d DATASET_ID`.
3. [Train](documentation/how_to_use_longiseg.md#training) your model: `LongiSeg_train DATASET_NAME_OR_ID UNET_CONFIGURATION FOLD`
4. Run [inference](documentation/how_to_use_longiseg.md#inference) on unseen data: `LongiSeg_predict -i INPUT_FOLDER -o OUTPUT_FOLDER -path /path/to/patients.json -d DATASET_ID`
5. Run [evaluation](documentation/how_to_use_longiseg.md#evaluation) on the predicted segmentation: `LongiSeg_evaluate_folder GT_FOLDER PRED_FOLDER -djfile /path/to/dataset.json -pfile /path/to/plans.json -patfile /path/to/patients.json`

## Compatibility with nnU-Net
LongiSeg is fully compatible with nnU-Net and can be installed alongside it in the same environment. This allows users to seamlessly reuse existing nnU-Net structures, datasets, and preprocessing pipelines without modification.

## ðŸ”— Also check out: LesionLocator â€“ Zero-Shot Tumor Tracking & Segmentation

If you're working on **lesion or tumor segmentation and tracking**, make sure to also check out our **LesionLocator** framework, introduced at **CVPR 2025**:

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2502.20985-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20985)

ðŸŽ¯ **LesionLocator** is a powerful **zero-shot framework** for segmentation and longitudinal tracking of lesions in 3D whole-body imaging â€” no lesion-specific training required. It supports **prompt-based segmentation** (e.g., 3D point or box prompts) and **autoregressive tracking** across timepoints.

ðŸ‘‰ GitHub: [https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/LesionLocator](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/LesionLocator)  

LesionLocator and LongiSeg share a focus on **longitudinal analysis**, but with different strengths:
- **LongiSeg** is ideal for fully supervised, dataset-specific training with temporal modeling across timepoints.
- **LesionLocator** excels at **zero-shot generalization** and supports interactive & promptable workflows out of the box.

Use them **together** to benchmark traditional vs. zero-shot approaches â€” or combine insights from both for even better longitudinal segmentation performance.
